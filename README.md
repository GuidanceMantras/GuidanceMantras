### Education for Government jobs

- Best example is Tina Dabi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Dabi, she took Arts(Political science) in PUC and B.A. in political science and her major in UPSC was Political science.
- So Tina Dabi studied only political science to clear IAS exam at 21 years old. She was not bright students, but intelligent and clever students. Anyway, her parents are Indian officers and her parents knew what to do and what to study for government exams.
- If you are aiming for government exams, always make a plan and go for it, you get success. You can not follow Tina Dabi blindly. you need proper plan and execution
- If you are aiming for government jobs, always start preparing from 18 years old after PUC, so that you can have a good government job by 24-25 years old

### How-to-decide-which-Job-either-Government-or-Private
- if you are not from Financially well and stable family, one kid go for government and other kid go to private so. 
- So private kid can support family until other kid gets government job
- Sometimes, both the kids take risk to go for government jobs, even they are not from financially well stable family. I would never recommend it
  
### Government Jobs
- At maxminum, spend only 4-5 years for government jobs, if you do not get government within 4-5 years, focus on private jobs or own business
- There are lots of government jobs for engineering degree holder in Civil/Electrical/Mechanical via SSC(Staff Selection Committe)/(State)PSC
- Always remember government exams are not tough, but it is competative. More people wants government jobs. so
- Yes, there are lots of struggles to get government job, but that struggle is less compared to struggle in working for private company after 30 years old. When you are young and in 20's, you can take risk and struggle to get a government job, not after 30 years old.
- Many people in private jobs levae their job to write government jobs and also some people write government jobs while working in private jobs
- There is a myth in government exmas, so that many people apply for government exams. Let's say, there are 1,00,000 applications for a job, only 20,000 to 30,000 are serious exam takers(which means only 20%-30% applicants studied well for the exams)
- Trust me government exams are not tough, but competative. Even once 10th/12th failed people clear big UPSC exams with preparation. so you just need mindsets to clear the government exams.
